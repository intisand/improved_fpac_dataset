0,BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS AUTHOR By Brian Killen Reuters AUTHOR CHICAGO March Brazil s recent announcement of asuspension in interest payments on billion dlrs of foreigndebt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed viewsamong many international economists and commodities analyststhat Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in The developing world s most indebted nation is also itsmost prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such ascoffee and soybeans and might maximize foreign exchangerevenue by selling hard on world markets economists said That sounds like a reasonable strategy But there is noway they can trade their way out of this situation AldoRoldan Vice President for International Services at ChaseEconometrics said Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle theproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on gluttedworld markets but also had to work to make its position onforeign exchange markets more profitable Domestic costs have increased due to inflation andexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchangerates Roldan said The Chase economist also said commodities markets weredepressed and generally did not appear very promising for acountry like Brazil where pure commodities account for some pct of exports and in had a total value of around billion dlrs But he added They are always pretty aggressive and theyhave good foreign marketing channels Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will becoffee and even without background pressure from foreigncreditors the world s largest producer was expected to hit themarket this year with a vengeance Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ICO members to re establish producer export quotas broke upearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusingeach other of intransigence Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations which others wanted changed one senior coffee dealer said The dealer who declined to be named said Brazil wanted topreserve its market share At the end of the talks he saidBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and otherswould suffer Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario butas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales thedealer said If they do come into the market at this level it will golower and you could breach a dollar ninety or eighty cents he said New York coffee futures for May delivery settled centslower Thursday at cents a lb while more distantdeliveries fell the six cent maximum trading limit President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute Jorio Daustertold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil hasno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown ofthe ICO talks on export quotas Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be thefocus of possible stepped up Brazilian marketing efforts Theywill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been according to Richard Loewy analyst for Prudential BacheSecurities Inc Loewy believes the foreign debt problem a good crop plusdifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of theBrazil soybean crop Brazilian farmers also need cash flow andthey can t afford to store the crops he said The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some timeabout large South American crops developing under near idealconditions towards record yields We are going to see a very rapid decline earlier thanusual this year in our U S exports Loewy said Tommy Eshleman economist for the American SoybeanAssociation ASA said this year s Brazilian soybean harvestcould total mln tonnes versus mln last year Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when pricesare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to thevulnerability of the U S crop to bad growing weather Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of areduction in the U S government soybean loan rate offered tofarmers who give crops as collateral Eshleman said He said there has been some uncertainty this year about thesoybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for pricesby keeping supplies away from the free market Farmers canforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay theloan We re getting into a period when they Brazil arestarting to harvest and starting to export Eshleman said Buthe added it will be a while before U S exports fall to below mln bushels a week from around mln bushels currently Jose Melicias from the research department of DrexelBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as muchas it can this year because of its economic situation He said the debt situation was a major consideration TheBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay forstorage he added Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazilwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops Melicias saidit would not make a big difference On other commodity markets Brazil s selling impact may bemuted no matter its need to generate capital Brazil is faced with a poor sugar harvest whichcould limit exports to the world market analysts said Thecountry may have oversold and be unable to honor exportcommitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused byconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar willgive it little room to stretch exports they said Brazil s other major crop cocoa is in its third year ofsurplus Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year itfell so I don t think they can start throwing out cocoa andfind many more markets for it one analyst said If they come out as aggressive sellers the market wouldcollapse and they can t afford to do that she added

0,EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA AUTHOR By Jeremy Lovell Reuters AUTHOR AMSTERDAM June European coffee roasters and tradershave agreed to propose a new formula for calculatingInternational Coffee Organization ICO quotas Dutch CoffeeTrade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said Van Horick who is a council member of the European CoffeeFederation was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting The new formula is based on six year moving averages andwould give Brazil the world s biggest coffee producer anunchanged quota for the remaining two years of the currentcoffee agreement van Horick said If accepted by the consumer and producer members of theICO the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a newagreement van Horick said Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year whenprices shot up on fears of a drought induced crop disaster inBrazil Although prices are now considerably lower consumers andproducers have been unable to agree on re introduction Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in theformula because it feared a lower quota But our proposalleaves it very little to object to van Horick said The existing quota system is far too rigid and does notreflect supply and demand reality he said Our formulabuilds flexibility into the system and will benefit almosteveryone Although full implications of the new formula have still tobe worked out initial estimates suggest countries such asColombia Kenya Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightlyhigher quotas while others such as the Ivory Coast ElSalvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share van Horick said Because the proposal provides that future quotadistribution must reflect current demand and actual supply itshould also prevent under shipment of quota as countries doingso would automatically prejudice their following year s quota If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at leasta fair chance of being accepted by the producers at theSeptember meeting most of whom are generally in favour of anew quota formula van Horick said At the same time much will depend on Brazil s attitude Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side Ifthere is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next twomonths and most other producers favour our proposal we mightjust get an agreement van Horick added

2,U S SAID TO VIEW G MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS AUTHOR By Peter Torday Reuters AUTHOR WASHINGTON April The United States which has longsought Japanese action to stimulate its economy appears to besatisfied Tokyo s latest package is a major development andallows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreementto stabilize currencies Monetary sources said they believed that U S TreasurySecretary James Baker considered Tokyo s package announcedyesterday to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy But yesterday s statement by seven leading industrialpowers endorses the yen s rise from around to the dollar the level at the February Paris Accord to about today And the initial reaction of currency markets in the FarEast demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced thatcurrencies yet reflect economic fundamentals even though thecountries appear to do so The yen sank below at one pointdespite intervention by the Bank of Japan Kiichi Miyazawa Japan s Finance Minister said themovement since Paris was consistent with currency tradingranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks I would say that what has happened to the yen in the pastseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in thediscussions in Paris Miyazawa said yesterday The supplementary budget worth about billion dlrs wasannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve ofMiyazawa s departure for Washington to attend yesterday smeetings of leading industrial nations In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action extraordinary and urgent the meeting reaffirmed the ParisAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within rangesbroadly consistent with fundamentals or economic reality The Group of Seven the United States Japan WestGermany France Britain Italy and Canada thereforerepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation tofoster exchange rate stability The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted centralbank intervention of billion to billion dlrs to halt thedollar s fall While relatively unsuccessful the scale ofintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recentyears Monetary sources also said they understood thatSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremelysuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement They also said there was a growing feeling among thefinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation overmedium term policies has replaced the bickering over short termdifferences in past meetings West Germany whose currency has not risen anything likethe yen since the Paris Agreement appears from the face ofyesterday s statement to have won acceptance from othercountries that its exchange rate is acceptable Bonn s finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues thatmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalancebetween West Germany and Japan s trade surpluses and America strade deficit have already taken place No mention was made however of the U S commitment to cutthe budget deficit even though it is implied in thereafffirmation of Paris European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts areessential to curbing the record U S trade shortfall thatreached nearly billion dlrs last year A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier thisweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker A furthersharp fall to redress trade imbalances would clearly posesubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and couldundermine confidence in future financial stability he said Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force thepolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates Monetary sources said that privately West Germanywelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its owncurrency remained relatively stable against the U S unit Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weakdollar blunts Tokyo s export drive to the United States theJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets The ministers meanwhile also continued talks on makingtheir policy coordination more binding and one CanadianFinance Minister Michael Wilson said good progress was made Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summitto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations The United States and France backed by the InternationalMonetary Fund want the seven to agree on ranges or norms for alimited number of economic objectives such as growth inflation monetary conditions trade balances and currentaccount balances Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result inconsultations between the countries on whether correctiveaction should be required But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectiveshas Bonn and London worried monetary sources say because itimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfullysounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limitcurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret rangesof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from therelatively free currency markets

3,FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U S FEBRUARY ECONOMY AUTHOR By Kathleen Hays Reuters AUTHOR NEW YORK March U S February reports reflecting slimgains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressuresreinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continueto follow a stable course of monetary policy economists said If you re the Fed there s no reason to do anything saidSteve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc There are hints that GNP is picking up On the inflationfront all is well he said Money supply is well undercontrol It s an absolutely ideal situation February U S industrial production rose pct slightlyless than the pct gain the financial markets had expected This compared with a slim pct rise in January s productionnumber previously reported as a pct increase The February U S producer price index gained only pct less than a pct expected rise This followed a pctrise in the PPI in January The Fed is going to look at this positively said AllanLeslie of Discount Corporation Certainly inflation is not asbad as what Volcker Fed Chairman has said lately Industrialproduction growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants The energy products component of PPI rose pct inFebruary after a pct increase in January This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflationis behind us in terms of the move from dlrs to dlrs perbarrel said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc Thetrend is still pct in the first half of the year In declining energy prices contributed to a pctdecline in the PPI Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected but a sharp drop in auto prices was not Passenger car pricesfell pct and light truck prices dropped pct Yesterday Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said thata possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in boththe financial markets and the Federal Reserve The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectationstoday said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easiermonetary policy Brusca said if import prices do not rise thiscould necessitate a weaker dollar The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air hesaid We need inflation for U S producers to compete withforeign producers Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped pctin February s PPI With many electronic goods producedoverseas this may show that foreign producers are not raisingprices which bodes ill for U S competitiveness he said If further dollar declines are needed this could diminishoverseas investment in U S debt Brusca added which mightnecessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices By contrast Slifer said imported goods prices rose pct from first quarter to first quarter reflecting toa large degree a pct drop in the trade weighted real valueof the dollar from February to February Slifer said import prices may rise further asmanufacturers contracts put in place before the dollar droppedto current levels expire and new contracts are made thatreflect a weaker dollar David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that importedmanufactured goods prices rose pct at an annual rate in thesecond half of which has contributed to rising U S industrial output It s the other side of the lower dollar Wyss said Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitiveand they are increasing output Wyss said that the latest data point to an averageindustrial production gain of pct in the first quarter It s an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector isbeginning to revive But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains Hesaid much of the strength came from factors that do not pointto a sustained rise in industrial output Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farmequipment industries helped account for a one pct rise inFebruary business equipment production Utilities output rose pct in February after gaining pct in January but Roach said it shows mostly that more energywas produced not that manufacturing activity gained Finally he pointed out that auto production accounted forhalf of the industrial production gain as production of autoassemblies rose to million units at an annual rate from million units In the first quarter it looks like automakers areproducing at an mln unit annual rate but selling atroughly a seven mln unit rate Roach said The disparitybetween output and sales is showing up in inventories Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U S businessinventories as a sign that production may be outstrippingdemand in the first quarter of January business inventories rose pct the largest gainsince July when inventories rose pct the CommerceDepartment said Business sales dropped pct in January thelargest monthly sales drop on record Nonetheless economists do not expect the Fed to react tomonth to month changes The Fed has been standing pat for thelast seven months Ramirez said They will continue to standpat for at least the next couple of months

calendar He said the Treasury expected a current account balance ofpayments deficit in of billion stg after a billion shortfall in Inflation is expected to be pct at the end of thisyear Lawson said As I forecast in the Autumn Statement inflation maycontinue to edge up for a time perhaps exceeding pct bythe summer before falling back to pct by the end of theyear he added Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement PSBR Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal was billion stg or pct of GDP The planned PSBR for was set at billion stg On monetary policy Lawson confirmed the target range forthe narrow M measure would be two to six pct in fiscal No explicit target was set for the broad sterling Maggregate he said But broad money will continue to be takeninto account in assessing monetary conditions as of coursewill the exchange rate the Chancellor told Parliament Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in ischiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non oil taxrevenues in general and the corporation tax paid by anincreasingly profitable business sector in particular On oil prices Lawson said he was sticking to his earlierassumption that North Sea crude prices will average dlrs perbarrel in calendar He said it is clear that the increased flow of non oil taxrevenues coupled with the prospective further growth of theeconomy in excess of the growth of public expenditure puts thepublic finances in a very strong position Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at pct of GDP in future We have reached what I judge to be the Medium TermFinancial Strategy s appropriate destination a PSBR of pct of GDP My aim will be to keep it there over the yearsahead Lawson said Inevitably this greatly diminishes the scope I have thisyear for reducing the burden of taxation which of courseremains a major objective of government policy But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudenceand caution and to build a still firmer base for the future Lawson said the time had come to strike the ExchangeControl Act from the Statute book On corporation tax he said the rate will remain unchangedat pct in But companies capital gains will becharged at the appropriate corporation tax rate He said that under the new proposed system companiesshould be able to set Advanced Capital Tax ACT paymentsagainst tax on capital gains Taken together these changes should yield mln stg in Lawson said Lawson said he will propose that all companies and buildingsocieties be treated the same way on payment of corporationtax with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months afterthe end of the accounting period on which the tax is due I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a newmethod of collecting corporation tax to be known as Pay andFile This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining taxcollection and would not come into force until the earlys Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT As from today companies may elect to have up to pctof the costs of developing certain new fields set against their PRT liabilities in existing fields until the income of thosenew fields exceeds the costs incurred Second there will be a new relief against PRT for spendingon research into U K Oil extraction that is not related to anyparticular field On business employment Lawson said employers will receivetax relief for retraining workers Lawson said that in future traders registered for ValueAdded Tax VAT would be able to choose to account for the taxon the basis of cash paid and received Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead ofquarterly The VAT compulsory registration period was beingextended to days he added and VAT registration thresholdsare to be raised to stg New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance he added The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now beset at stg Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companiesin multinational groups with dual residence will no longer beable to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment The change will take effect on April but genuinetrading companies will not be affected He also planned to end the present treatment of tax creditrelief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bankloans also from April In future banks will be able to offset this tax creditonly against tax on the profit on the relevant loan he said The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by twopence to pct from pct Lawson reiterated the government s aim of reducing basictaxation to pence in the pound but added given my decisionto use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have toreduce the PSBR that goal cannot be achieved in this budget Small companies corporation tax is also being reduced to pct he said On the Lloyd s insurance market Lawson said he planned tochange the tax treatment of Lloyd s syndicates bringing itinto line with that of provisions for outstanding

the fourth quarter last year privateeconomists say Some of the slowness experienced in the October Decemberperiod had been expected to spill over into the first quarterthis year as the tax law changes that went into effect inJanuary slowed business and consumer spending But some of the latest economic data show signs ofsurprising strength in the U S economy although someeconomists remain cautious about the outlook The Commerce Department reported today that new orders fordurable goods in February jumped by billion dlrs a six pctrise to billion dlrs Even excluding volatile defensegoods durable goods orders rose a healthy pct the agencysaid The February numbers surpassed the expectations of manyfinancial analysts whose predictions ranged from flat toincreases of up to five pct The January

Association The U S jobless rate in February and January was pct the lowest rate since March The number of new non farmjobs rose by in February after a gain inJanuary and a December increase the government said The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate ofabout three to pct in the first quarter said Gramley Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuildingtheir inventories

residential constructiondeclining mostly for multi family housing units Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of thefourth quarter slowness will continue Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant pct rate in thefirst quarter of accelerate during the second quarter andshow a brisk pct annual rate in the third quarter The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in theU S trade balance which is expected because of the decline inthe dollar s value over the last year and half The improvement will be gradual and long lasting Levypredicted Most of it will be through import reduction but atleast one third will be due to a rise in product exports as theprices of U S goods become more attractive overseas The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit which soared to record levels last year will improve this yearand the U S economy will grow by a respectable pct for theyear compared with a pct rate last year As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit the U S has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate theirdomestic demand for goods from the U S and others U S officials believe that would help take some of thepressure off the United States whose five years of economicgrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries The U S economy provided them with a giant market fortheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed toservice their foreign debt The government last week said the U S economy grew at amodest pct annual rate during the fourth quarter There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalancebetween the volume of goods imported to the United States andthose shipped abroad The report showed a rising volume ofexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the factthat in

thecountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in mostregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said thepick up in the U S manufacturing sector is largely due to thedrop in the dollar s value He said he does not foresee a majorpick up in economic activity but does not believe the economywill slip into recession either He said higher prices on imported products and wage cutsthat have helped the manufacturing sector will squeezeconsumers purchasing power That pattern is starting

6,BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS AUTHOR By Brian Killen Reuters AUTHOR CHICAGO March Brazil s recent announcement of asuspension in interest payments on billion dlrs of foreigndebt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed viewsamong many international economists and commodities analyststhat Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in The developing world s most indebted nation is also itsmost prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such ascoffee and soybeans and might maximize foreign exchangerevenue by selling hard on world markets economists said That sounds like a reasonable strategy But there is noway they can trade their way out of this situation AldoRoldan Vice President for International Services at ChaseEconometrics said Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle theproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on gluttedworld markets but also had to work to make its position onforeign exchange markets more profitable Domestic costs have increased due to inflation andexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchangerates Roldan said The Chase economist also said commodities markets weredepressed and generally did not appear very promising for acountry like Brazil where pure commodities account for some pct of exports and in had a total value of around billion dlrs But he added They are always pretty aggressive and theyhave good foreign marketing channels Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will becoffee and even without background pressure from foreigncreditors the world s largest producer was expected to hit themarket this year with a vengeance Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ICO members to re establish producer export quotas broke upearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusingeach other of intransigence Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations which others wanted changed one senior coffee dealer said The dealer who declined to be named said Brazil wanted topreserve its market share At the end of the talks he saidBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and otherswould suffer Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario butas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales thedealer said If they do come into the market at this level it will golower and you could breach a dollar ninety or eighty cents he said New York coffee futures for May delivery settled centslower Thursday at cents a lb while more distantdeliveries fell the six cent maximum trading limit President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute Jorio Daustertold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil hasno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown ofthe ICO talks on export quotas Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be thefocus of possible stepped up Brazilian marketing efforts Theywill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been according to Richard Loewy analyst for Prudential BacheSecurities Inc Loewy believes the foreign debt problem a good crop plusdifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of theBrazil soybean crop Brazilian farmers also need cash flow andthey can t afford to store the crops he said The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some timeabout large South American crops developing under near idealconditions towards record yields We are going to see a very rapid decline earlier thanusual this year in our U S exports Loewy said Tommy Eshleman economist for the American SoybeanAssociation ASA said this year s Brazilian soybean harvestcould total mln tonnes versus mln last year Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when pricesare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to thevulnerability of the U S crop to bad growing weather Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of areduction in the U S government soybean loan rate offered tofarmers who give crops as collateral Eshleman said He said there has been some uncertainty this year about thesoybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for pricesby keeping supplies away from the free market Farmers canforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay theloan We re getting into a period when they Brazil arestarting to harvest and starting to export Eshleman said Buthe added it will be a while before U S exports fall to below mln bushels a week from around mln bushels currently Jose Melicias from the research department of DrexelBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as muchas it can this year because of its economic situation He said the debt situation was a major consideration TheBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay forstorage he added Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazilwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops Melicias saidit would not make a big difference On other commodity markets Brazil s selling impact may bemuted no matter its need to generate capital Brazil is faced with a poor sugar harvest whichcould limit exports to the world market analysts said Thecountry may have oversold and be unable to honor exportcommitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused byconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar willgive it little room to stretch exports they said Brazil s other major crop cocoa is in its third year ofsurplus Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year itfell so I don t think they can start throwing out cocoa andfind many more markets for it one analyst said If they come out as aggressive sellers the market wouldcollapse and they can t afford to do that she added

6,SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER AUTHOR By Nelson Graves Reuters AUTHOR WASHINGTON April Speculation the United States willoffer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to havereached a new level of intensity in the run up to Secretary ofState George Shultz visit later this month to Moscow Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheatmarkets since officials from the two countries held theircustomary semi annual grain talks in February Moscow sdecision at that time to reenter the U S corn marketstrengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April Shultz statement two weeks ago that he would not stand inthe way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export EnhancementProgram EEP coupled with the announcement of his visit toMoscow was interpreted by many grain trade representativeshere as a clear signal that the Reagan administration waspreparing an offer Administration officials in and out of the U S Agriculture Department have been extremely tight lippedabout the prospects of a subsidy offer But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned thecontention the proposal is dormant suggesting that an offer while not a done deal is a live possibility Prominent U S grain trade representatives many of whomasked not to be identified continue to maintain that anoffer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent Others who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible are saying they would not rule one out Rep Pat Roberts R Kan yesterday went so far as topredict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten daysto two weeks Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaderswho had been in contact with administration officials Richard Fritz director of international marketing at U S Wheat Associates said he was confident an export enhancementoffer would be made by the middle of this month Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would endup being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier thisyear when USDA approved subsidies to China of around dlrsper tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat Some grain trade representatives say a four mln tonne wheatsubsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases ofU S corn and open the door to U S sales of soybeans As ever one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat dealwould appear to be price Last summer the administration took the controversial stepof offering the Soviets subsidized wheat but wereembarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the groundsthat the dlr per tonne subsidy still left U S wheat pricesfar above world market prices The administration s decision to set the subsidy level upfront instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be ameans of controlling the price while attempting to dampencriticism grain trade sources said Nonetheless the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultzfrom saying the Soviets were chortling because Washington wasoffering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available toU S housewives The conventional wisdom among grain trade representativeshere is that a general warming of relations between the twocountries since last summer combined with continued hard timesin the U S grain belt would favor a subsidy offer In addition the USSR has made it clear it would considerbuying U S wheat if it were priced more competitively However observers have not forgotten the circumstancessurrounding the administration s announcement of the wheatsubsidy offer last summer Up until the time of the announcment congressional andindustry leaders were led to believe the White House haddecided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include notonly the Soviets but also a much broader list of countries Instead the administration scaled back the offer toinclude only the Soviets That last minute change of heart adds a measure ofuncertainty even to the predictions of those most convincedthat the administration will not now pass up the opportunity tosell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union

7,BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS AUTHOR By Brian Killen Reuters AUTHOR CHICAGO March Brazil s recent announcement of asuspension in interest payments on billion dlrs of foreigndebt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed viewsamong many international economists and commodities analyststhat Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in The developing world s most indebted nation is also itsmost prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such ascoffee and soybeans and might maximize foreign exchangerevenue by selling hard on world markets economists said That sounds like a reasonable strategy But there is noway they can trade their way out of this situation AldoRoldan Vice President for International Services at ChaseEconometrics said Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle theproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on gluttedworld markets but also had to work to make its position onforeign exchange markets more profitable Domestic costs have increased due to inflation andexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchangerates Roldan said The Chase economist also said commodities markets weredepressed and generally did not appear very promising for acountry like Brazil where pure commodities account for some pct of exports and in had a total value of around billion dlrs But he added They are always pretty aggressive and theyhave good foreign marketing channels Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will becoffee and even without background pressure from foreigncreditors the world s largest producer was expected to hit themarket this year with a vengeance Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ICO members to re establish producer export quotas broke upearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusingeach other of intransigence Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations which others wanted changed one senior coffee dealer said The dealer who declined to be named said Brazil wanted topreserve its market share At the end of the talks he saidBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and otherswould suffer Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario butas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales thedealer said If they do come into the market at this level it will golower and you could breach a dollar ninety or eighty cents he said New York coffee futures for May delivery settled centslower Thursday at cents a lb while more distantdeliveries fell the six cent maximum trading limit President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute Jorio Daustertold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil hasno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown ofthe ICO talks on export quotas Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be thefocus of possible stepped up Brazilian marketing efforts Theywill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been according to Richard Loewy analyst for Prudential BacheSecurities Inc Loewy believes the foreign debt problem a good crop plusdifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of theBrazil soybean crop Brazilian farmers also need cash flow andthey can t afford to store the crops he said The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some timeabout large South American crops developing under near idealconditions towards record yields We are going to see a very rapid decline earlier thanusual this year in our U S exports Loewy said Tommy Eshleman economist for the American SoybeanAssociation ASA said this year s Brazilian soybean harvestcould total mln tonnes versus mln last year Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when pricesare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to thevulnerability of the U S crop to bad growing weather Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of areduction in the U S government soybean loan rate offered tofarmers who give crops as collateral Eshleman said He said there has been some uncertainty this year about thesoybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for pricesby keeping supplies away from the free market Farmers canforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay theloan We re getting into a period when they Brazil arestarting to harvest and starting to export Eshleman said Buthe added it will be a while before U S exports fall to below mln bushels a week from around mln bushels currently Jose Melicias from the research department of DrexelBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as muchas it can this year because of its economic situation He said the debt situation was a major consideration TheBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay forstorage he added Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazilwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops Melicias saidit would not make a big difference On other commodity markets Brazil s selling impact may bemuted no matter its need to generate capital Brazil is faced with a poor sugar harvest whichcould limit exports to the world market analysts said Thecountry may have oversold and be unable to honor exportcommitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused byconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar willgive it little room to stretch exports they said Brazil s other major crop cocoa is in its third year ofsurplus Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year itfell so I don t think they can start throwing out cocoa andfind many more markets for it one analyst said If they come out as aggressive sellers the market wouldcollapse and they can t afford to do that she added

7,EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED AUTHOR By Douglas Learmond Reuters AUTHOR LONDON March European sugar beet plantings areexpected to show little change from last year despite recentfirmness in world prices analysts and industry sources said A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while so far European Community EC growers plan unchanged to lowerareas increases are expected in some Eastern European nations Trade analysts said their private reports give similarresults and do not differ significantly from the first estimateof stagnant European beet plantings made last week by WestGerman sugar statistician F O Licht Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agriculturalexperts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improvedseed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this In recent years good autumn weather has given yields a lateboost making up for lower areas despite some disappointingstarts to growing seasons Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producerswill grow so called C sugar for unsubsidised sale to the worldmarket This is what is produced in excess of the basic areaneeded to meet the EC A and B quotas which receive full andpartial price support respectively Some analysts said the open row that broke out last weekbetween producers and the EC commission over its export policycould have serious implications for future sugar output Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearlyone mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks asthey feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate forthe gap between high EC internal and low world market prices However with the EC budget stretched to breaking point this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resistinghigher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a futurecut in the basic A and B quotas they added In France the largest producer of EC quota and non quotasugar the sugar market intervention board FIRS

prices began to rise putplantings this year at hectares against in Nowicki said Last year production was mln tonnes World prices have less impact in Italy than in France orGermany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared tothe domestic market an official at the national beet growers association said Italian sowings are not yet complete butsurveys suggest a drop from last

7,SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT AUTHOR By Richard Jarvie Reuters AUTHOR RIO DE JANEIRO March Latin American sugar producersare awaiting further rises in world market prices before movingto boost production official and trade sources said Although prices have risen to around eight from five U S Cents per lb in the past six months they are still below theregion s nine to ten cents per lb average production cost The recent rise in prices has placed producers on thealert Manuel Rico a consultant with the Group of LatinAmerican and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries GEPLACEA told Reuters However Rico said it would require another five to sevencents to stimulate notable increases in output Producers are taking measures for increasing theirproduction when the prices are profitable he said Officials in Mexico Guatemala and Ecuador said a continuedrise in prices would stimulate production but industry leadersin Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go The prices are ridiculous said Julian Mateo vicepresident of Costa Rica s Sugar Cane Industrial AgriculturalLeague At current prices nobody is going to considerincreasing production Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasingoutput given the instability of world markets An official at Colombia s National Association of SugarCane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets The market is very unstable What is happening is not yetgiving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modifyanything In the latest year for which full figures areavailable Central and South American nations produced mlntonnes raw value of sugar of which mln were exported Ayear earlier they had produced and exported about more according to the London based International SugarOrganization Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugarindustry in many countries in the region into a recession fromwhich it will be hard to recover Miguel Guerrero director of the Dominican Republic sNational Sugar Institute said it would be difficult to boostproduction even if prices recovered sharply Output had slumped to under tonnes a year from in the late s Obsolete refineries poor transportand badly maintained plantations were barriers to any shortterm recovery in output he added Plans of nearby Cuba the world s largest cane sugarexporter to increase output to mln tonnes a year by the endof the decade seem ambitious trade sources said Output isrunning well below the record mln produced in Cuba suffers from run down plantations harvesting problemsand poor processing facilities more than from low world prices since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countriesunder special deals Last year bad weather added to itstroubles and output fell to mln tonnes from mln in The low world prices of recent years have led manycountries in the region to cut exportable production to levelswhere they barely cover U S And in the case of some Caribbeancountries European Community EC import quotas for whichthey receive prices well above free market levels Progressive reductions in the U S Quotas have led toproduction stagnating or falling rather than being shifted tothe free world market Peru for example shipped tonnes to the U S Inboth and This fell to in and this yearits quota is only A national cooperative official said that as long as worldmarket levels continue at around half of Peru s productioncost the future of the industry is uncertain At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officialsstressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar canewhich according to the group s executive secretary EduardoLatorre grows like a weed throughout the region Brazil the largest cane producer with output of around mln tonnes uses over half to produce alcohol fuel Cane inexcess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined intosugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency The difference in the price the state run Sugar and AlcoholInstitute IAA pays local industry and what it receives fromforeign buyers costs the government some mln dlrs a year Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over thepast year coupled with a drought reduced cane crop has meantBrazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in trade sources said Negotiations to delay shipments tonext year have been indecisive so far the main sticking pointbeing how Brazil should compensate buyers for non delivery ofsugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which wouldcost eight cents to replace Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar exportsales were expected to be extremely low for the next year withthe Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages ofeither alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuilddepleted reserve stockpiles However the situation could change dramatically if theeconomy goes into recession and internal demand slumps Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold littlehope for the region s sugar industry to return to profitabilityunless the U S And EC change their policies The agricultural policies of the European Community and ofthe United States have caused our economies incalculable harmby closing their markets by price deterioration ininternational commerce and furthermore by the unfaircompetition in third countries Brazil s Trade and IndustryMinister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEAmeeting The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA forwhat the group charges is its continued dumping of excessoutput on world markets GEPLACEA officials say this is themain cause of low prices GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement whichwould regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling theregion s industry out of steady decline Such an agreementwould have to have both U S And EC backing and industrialisedcountries would have to see it as a political rather than amerely

7,EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS CONCESSION TO PRODUCERS BRUSSELS March The rebate granted at yesterday s ECsugar tender represents some concession to producers complaints that they are losing money on exports outside thebloc EC Commission officials said The maximum rebate of European currency units Ecus per kilos was Ecus below what producers say is neededto obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales intointervention The rebate at last week s tender was Ecus per kilosshort of the level producers said was needed the officialssaid The officials said the Commission is not negotiating withproducers who have offered a total of tonnes of sugarfor sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuadeit to offer higher rebates They said the French and German producers involved are nowunable to withdraw this offer before April when the sugarwill officially enter intervention stores Payment for it is due five weeks later and it will be opento them to withdraw their offers at any time between April and the official payment date when the Commission officiallytakes ownership of the sugar the officials said The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar it is determined to immediately resell it a move which woulddrive down market prices further They expressed some hope that the operators would noteventually go through with their plan for intervention sales We think they realise they have gone too far one officialsaid 
7,EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET LONDON March Sugar which EC producers plan to sellinto intervention may be offered by the European Commission forsale within the Community broker C Czarnikow says in itslatest sugar review The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a verynominal premium of European Currency Unit Ecu to theintervention price with detrimental consequences forproducers returns Czarnikow says The move is seen as anattempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrenderedsugar The Commission may also take other steps to dissuadeproducers from their chosen course such as removing the timelimit on storage contracts which presently means thatintervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September Czarnikow says There is also the possibility of productionquotas being reduced If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders forexport the restitutions would have to be higher than those atrecent export tenders Czarnikow notes To match the differencebetween the EC price and the world market price the extracosts might be as much as Ecus per tonne it says The producers might have to repay these costs throughproduction levies and the proposed special elimination levy Czarnikow says but it would be several months before any costscould be recovered under EC rules The primary cause of the plan to sell tonnes ofsugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with theEC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed tobridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price Czarnikow notes The French move is thus seen as a form ofprotest designed to force the Commission s hand In West Germany tonnes have been tendered forintervention but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensurethat the price is paid for sugar that was produced in In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price West German producers face a further price reduction in Julywith a probable revaluation of the green mark Even if the immediate crisis is resolved the problem isnot expected to disappear permanently It has appeared totraders for some years that the EC s export policy isinsufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand itsays The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand byincreasing or reducing the tonnage awarded Czarnikow says suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cutdown the amount of unnecessary bureaucracy surrounding theexport tender system
