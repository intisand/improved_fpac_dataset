luck andplanning said Pace s John Dosher Dosher said last year s fall in oil prices made feedstocksdramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollarwas weakening against foreign currencies That helped boostU S chemical exports Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance hasbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemicalmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern

1,IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED LONDON March Efforts by governments to control wheatsurpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partialsuccess the International Wheat Council IWC says in itslatest monthly report Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducingboth price and areas as employed in the United States the IWCsays in a survey of support prices in the five main wheatexporters Argentina Australia Canada the EC and the U S In some countries for example Australia and Argentina which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for exportincome there may be problems in reducing production A policy of cutting wheat production could lead tounemployment with job prospects outside agriculture limited Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could thenlead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems The IWC outlines three courses of action open togovernments in wheat exporting countries They could continue to support prices in the hope that whenthe world economy improves demand for wheat will rise andsurpluses wil be reduced or eliminated Alternatively support could be limited to wheat whichcould be easily sold without needing to be stored for a longperiod This option may prove to be the most politicallyunattractive and would result in many producers abandoningwheat production the report said The third option would be for governments to distinguishbetween the commercial and social aspects of agriculture possibly varying support prices according to farm size oroverall production The IWC review covers support prices in the major exportingcountries since At some time during that period all theproducers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses These changes did not always result in lower exportsubsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations morethan offset lower prices in the domestic currency For example between and the EC interventionprice for bread wheat fell from to Europeancurrency units Ecus It dollar terms the currency in whichmost export transactions are denominated the interventionprice however rose to dlrs from The high cost ofsupporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequersand some governments are now searching for ways to cutexpenditure the report says The proportion of world wheat output produced by the fivemajor exporters declined in the period covered by the surveyfrom pct in to pct in This was partly due toincreased production in China and India The period saw an upward trend in yields although this wascountered in the Argentina the U S And Australia by loweracreages In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about percent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch toother enterprises particularly livestock while lower U S Acreages are attributed to official incentives

2,U S URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN AUTHOR By PETER TORDAY Reuters AUTHOR WASHINGTON March The U S is urging reluctantcommercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novelPhilippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believesthe innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debtstrategy a Reagan administration official said The official s comments also suggest that debtors pleasfor interest rate concessions should be treated much moreseriously by the commercial banks in cases where developingnations are carrying out genuine economic reforms In addition he signaled that the banks might want toreconsider the idea of a megabank where Third World debt wouldbe pooled and suggested the administration would support sucha plan even though it was not formally proposing it At thesame time however the official expressed reservations thatsuch a scheme would ever get off the ground The Philippine proposal together with Argentinesuggestions that exit bonds be issued to end the troublesomerole of small banks in the debt strategy would help tounderpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan the official said in an interview with Reuters All of these things would fit within the definition of ourinitiative as we have asked it and we think any novel andunique approach such as those should be considered said theofficial who asked not to be named In October Washington outlined a debt crisis strategyunder which commercial banks and multilateral institutions suchas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund IMF were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations In return America called on the debtor countries to enacteconomic reforms promoting inflation free economic growth The multilaterals have been performing well the debtorshave been performing well said the official But he admittedthat the largest Third World debtor Brazil was clearly anexception The official who played a key role in developing the U S Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improvetheir role in resolving the Third World debt crisis We called at the very beginning for the bank syndicationsto find procedures or processes whereby they could operate moreeffectively the official said Among those ideas the official said were suggestions thatcommercial banks create a megabank which could swap Third Worlddebt paper for so called exit bonds for banks like regionalAmerican or European institutions Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need tolend money to their former debtors every time a new moneypackage was assembled and has been suggested by Argentina inits current negotiations for a new loan of billion dlrs He emphasised that the megabank was not an administrationplan but something some people have suggested Other U S Officials said Japanese commercial banks areexamining the creation of a consortium bank to assume ThirdWorld debt This plan actively under consideration woulddiffer slightly from the one the official described But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a planwould work in the United States If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go fine I don t think they ever will He pointed out that banks would swap their Third Worldloans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctantto provide new money to debtors through the new institution Meanwhile the official praised the Philippine plan underwhich it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at nomore than pct above Libor The Philippine proposal is very interesting it s quiteunique and I don t think it s something that should becategorically rejected out of hand the official said Banks which found this level unacceptably low would beoffered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a marginabove that of one pct in the form of Philippine InvestmentNotes These tradeable dollar denominated notes would have asix year life and if banks swapped them for cash beforematurity the country would guarantee a payment of pointover Libor Until now bankers have criticised these spreads as far toolow The talks now in their second week are aimed atstretching out repayments of billion dlrs of debt andgranting easier terms on billion of already rescheduleddebt The country which has enjoyed strong political supportin Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early lastyear owes an overall billion dlrs of debt But the official denied the plan amounts to interest ratecapitalisation a development until now unacceptable to thebanks It s no more interest rate capitalisation than if youhave a write down in the spread over Libor from what existedbefore the official said in comments suggesting some ought tobe granted the rate concessions they seek Some people arguethat cutting the spread is debt forgiveness What it reallyis is narrowing the spread on new money he added He said the U S Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as aninitiative to include plans like the Philippines

2,FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U S FEBRUARY ECONOMY AUTHOR By Kathleen Hays Reuters AUTHOR NEW YORK March U S February reports reflecting slimgains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressuresreinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continueto follow a stable course of monetary policy economists said If you re the Fed there s no reason to do anything saidSteve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc There are hints that GNP is picking up On the inflationfront all is well he said Money supply is well undercontrol It s an absolutely ideal situation February U S industrial production rose pct slightlyless than the pct gain the financial markets had expected This compared with a slim pct rise in January s productionnumber previously reported as a pct increase The February U S producer price index gained only pct less than a pct expected rise This followed a pctrise in the PPI in January The Fed is going to look at this positively said AllanLeslie of Discount Corporation Certainly inflation is not asbad as what Volcker Fed Chairman has said lately Industrialproduction growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants The energy products component of PPI rose pct inFebruary after a pct increase in January This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflationis behind us in terms of the move from dlrs to dlrs perbarrel said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc Thetrend is still pct in the first half of the year In declining energy prices contributed to a pctdecline in the PPI Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected but a sharp drop in auto prices was not Passenger car pricesfell pct and light truck prices dropped pct Yesterday Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said thata possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in boththe financial markets and the Federal Reserve The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectationstoday said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easiermonetary policy Brusca said if import prices do not rise thiscould necessitate a weaker dollar The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air hesaid We need inflation for U S producers to compete withforeign producers Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped pctin February s PPI With many electronic goods producedoverseas this may show that foreign producers are not raisingprices which bodes ill for U S competitiveness he said If further dollar declines are needed this could diminishoverseas investment in U S debt Brusca added which mightnecessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices By contrast Slifer said imported goods prices rose pct from first quarter to first quarter reflecting toa large degree a pct drop in the trade weighted real valueof the dollar from February to February Slifer said import prices may rise further asmanufacturers contracts put in place before the dollar droppedto current levels expire and new contracts are made thatreflect a weaker dollar David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that importedmanufactured goods prices rose pct at an annual rate in thesecond half of which has contributed to rising U S industrial output It s the other side of the lower dollar Wyss said Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitiveand they are increasing output Wyss said that the latest data point to an averageindustrial production gain of pct in the first quarter It s an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector isbeginning to revive But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains Hesaid much of the strength came from factors that do not pointto a sustained rise in industrial output Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farmequipment industries helped account for a one pct rise inFebruary business equipment production Utilities output rose pct in February after gaining pct in January but Roach said it shows mostly that more energywas produced not that manufacturing activity gained Finally he pointed out that auto production accounted forhalf of the industrial production gain as production of autoassemblies rose to million units at an annual rate from million units In the first quarter it looks like automakers areproducing at an mln unit annual rate but selling atroughly a seven mln unit rate Roach said The disparitybetween output and sales is showing up in inventories Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U S businessinventories as a sign that production may be outstrippingdemand in the first quarter of January business inventories rose pct the largest gainsince July when inventories rose pct the CommerceDepartment said Business sales dropped pct in January thelargest monthly sales drop on record Nonetheless economists do not expect the Fed to react tomonth to month changes The Fed has been standing pat for thelast seven months Ramirez said They will continue to standpat for at least the next couple of months

3,DOLLAR VALUE APPROPRIATE BUNDESBANK OFFICIAL SAYS LONDON March The dollar is near appropriate levelsagainst European currencies and the yen and a further fallcould damage confidence in the currency while endangering worldeconomic growth a top Bundesbank official said Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Associationconference current exchange rates of major currencies can beviewed as equilibrium levels in a medium term perspective He said the recent Paris agreement on currencystabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Fiveand Canada may herald an era of greater exchange ratestability The Paris agreement was not however an attempt to set uppermanent target zones for exchange rates Gleske stressed adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree andenforce on an international level At present levels the dollar can no longer be consideredgrossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies andthe yen Gleske said He said the dollar had fallen much less against currenciesof important trading nations such as Canada Korea Taiwan andHong Kong and further falls there may still be necessary But a further dollar depreciation against major Europeancurrencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore thedollar to a fully competitive position as measured by itsweighted external value he said In fact a further marked decline in the dollar rate wouldhold two major dangers Gleske said First in countries with large balance of paymentssurpluses such as Japan and West Germany it threatened tohamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of realincome and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe outsurpluses Second in the United States it could damage investors confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness tofinance huge fiscal and external payments deficits Gleskesaid Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an internationalsystem of binding target zones for currencies fluctuating innarrow bands against each other can be established Suchtargets threatened to cause policy conflicts both withincountries and between them For instance the U S Reliance on foreign capital to fundits deficits requires interest rates there be set at highlevels but domestic considerations call for low ones If target zones were established this would put pressureon other countries to reduce their interest rates even more even though this may be in conflict with their own domesticsituation and priorities he said Gleske added targeting the exchange rate even within awide margin will meet with serious objections where there is aclearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic andexternal policy priorities Commenting on the Paris currency accord Gleske said itschances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on currentinterest rate differentials being maintained These chances seem to me to rest critically on theexpectation that the current configuration of interest rates and the monetary policies behind them will assure smoothfinancing of current account imbalances in the months ahead Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments hadlearned that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thustend to overshoot He said this would seem to be unnecessaryand should be avoided if at all possible Monetary policies can help achieve this but only ifmarkets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies willlead to balanced international payments he said

3,U S APPEARS TO TOLERATE FURTHER DLR DECLINE AUTHOR By Peter Torday Reuters AUTHOR WASHINGTON March In a bid to hasten Japan s promiseto speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreigntrade top U S officials appear once again to have signaledtheir tolerance of a lower dollar Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides Assistant Secretary David Mulford said last week there was notarget for the dollar a statement that sent the yen soaringagainst the dollar despite massive central bank intervention That was no slip of the tongue said one western monetaryofficial who asked not to be identified For now the strategy appears to be working Japaneseofficials said late last week a package to bolster domesticdemand will be ready in early April Until last week therewere few indications the package would be ready anytime soon The Reagan administration facing an uproar in Congressover the apparent lack of progress in cutting the billiondlr trade deficit is learning now that to extract results fromJapan dramatic action is required Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs oncertain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhereto a semi conductor pricing accord between the two countries The shift in U S strategy in part designed to appeasemounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies comes justtwo weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to reviewthe Paris agreement to stabilize currencies And news that Japan earned a record billion dlr tradesurplus in the first two months this year just underscored theneed for urgent action in the view of U S officials Nonetheless U S officials see signs of improvement in thedeficit I d be stunned if we were not going to derive somebenefits from the lower dollar soon said one In Paris leading industrial nations agreed to cooperateclosely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting underlying economic fundamentals or economic reality The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japanand West Germany stimulating their economies and the UnitedStates cutting its budget deficit The three nations joined by France Britain and Canada agree these policies are essential to redress huge global tradeimbalances But analysts say markets have signalled the underlyingfundamentals imply a lower dollar rather than a stable one Markets in effect are less confident than governmentsthat these measures including U S budget deficit cutsagreed by Congress and the White House will be carried out Nonetheless the dollar s sharp fall has not undermined cooperation A U S economic policymaker said the accord was ontrack and Tokyo and Bonn seem to want more stimulative measureswhich is what the Paris accord calls for International monetary sources said exchange marketdevelopments generally have not unsettled policymakers although Japan is an obvious exception Everybody feels it canstill be managed one source said of market developments But last week the Bank of Japan spent an estimated fivebillion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen and othercentral banks about one billion dlrs Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America shalf hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar flouting theParis accord outright The source close to the top levels of Japanese economicpolicymaking said Japan s understanding of the accord was thatthe yen would be kept at around to the dollar the level itstood at when the accord was struck The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington suse of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies It was a pointed reminder to Japan to do something about the tradeissues the source said of the dollar s fall against the yen By departing last Sunday from the language of the Parisaccord that nations agreed to foster currency stabilityaround current levels Baker triggered a run on the dollar Later in the week Mulford too said there was no target forthe dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up totheir international responsibilities and stimulate growth But U S officials said recent market developments will notunravel the spirit of the Paris agreement There s a realisation now that you cannot leave thingsalone everyone agrees that the external trade imbalancesought to be adjusted one official said While no one is going to cede national sovereignty wecertainly seem to be moving towards much closer co operation another U S official said The officials said the meeting here where the six will bejoined by Italy will be a status report Japan will have to explain what the state of their programis and Germany will report on its plans Maybe there s a needto move faster one source said Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called ineffect for currency stability for several months This wouldbuy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economicgrowth and help bring down the U S trade deficit His comments appeared to serve notice on other majornations that Washington cannot wait too long for action toreduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surplusesand the U S trade deficit

3,U S FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX AUTHOR By Alver Carlson Reuters AUTHOR WASHINGTON MARCH The complex task of wielding controlover monetary policy in an increasingly fast moving globaleconomy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices thenewest member of the Federal Reserve Board says Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in themaking of monetary policy But they would be given a muchgreater role under an idea being floated by Governor RobertHeller who joined the board last August He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed butargues that such an arrangement particularly if it wereadopted by other major industrial countries could reduce thevolatility of exchange rates Moreover it could help stabilize of the prices ofcommodities themselves slowing changes in inflation His idea which many conservative economists findappealing has some backing among board members appointed inrecent years by President Reagan It would complement the present system of opening orclosing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation key indicators such as unemployment and the rise or fall ofthe money supply Changes in the money supply can lead tochanges in interest rates and affect economic activitydirectly Discussed on and off for a long time the commodity conceptis part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetarypolicy and widely fluxtuating currency prices to a more solidbase What is needed is an anchor or reference point that canserve as a guide for both domestic and international monetarypurposes says Heller In the past this anchor was gold but the United Stateswent off the gold standard because the global economy hadvastly outstripped gold supplies A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out ofhand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largestproducers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa The so called fixed rate system scuttled in the earlys is still considered unworkable in the present world But the current system of floating currencies in whichcurrencies can fluxtuate widely adding vast pressures to themonetary system is also being widely questioned Some have suggested that the system might benefit from aformal approach that mandates intervention by countries whencurrencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there aremajor problems with this also For one thing there is justifiable concern that countriesmight be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might bedetrimental to their own domestic economy Moreover some question whether concerted intervention canmake much of an inpact if the overall market does not agreewith the fundamental judgement The poorest countries have called for a monetary conferenceto work out a new system that not surprisingly helps themcope with their overpowering debt problems Treasury Secretary James Baker the Reagan administration schief economic architect has preferred to use the so calledGroup of Five industrial countries or sometimes Seven as aforum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and othereconomic matters He appears convinced that officials from West Germany France Britain Japan Italy and Canada talking quietly behindclosed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from publicposturing The Heller approach while extremely complex could have aprofound impact on the system ideally stabalizing prices andinternational exchange rates As envisioned by Heller a basket of say majorcommodities ranging from wheat to oil would be put togetherand prices would be measured on a regular basis In times of rising commodity prices monetary policy mightbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices montarypolicy might be eased he says He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auctionmarkets and a commodity price index can be calculated on avirtually continuous basis Moreover most commodity prices are produced consumed andtraded on a world wide basis so that an index has a relevancefor the entire world he says In addition commodity prices are at the beginning of theproduction chain and serve as an imput into virtually allproduction processes Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitiveindicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures the monetary authorities may take such an index into account inmaking their monetary policy decisions he says However he says that any major change in a basic commoditysuch as occurred in oil during the s because of action bythe OPEC cartel would have to be discounted in such a system He says the worst thing that could happen is to allowmonetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodityto the rest of the system and to other commodities

5,ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT POLISH SANCTIONS AUTHOR By Irena Czekierska Reuters AUTHOR WARSAW March Poland says U S Sanctions have cost itseconomy billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washingtonto take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remainingrestrictions two weeks ago Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdownof the figure saying it takes into account a number ofhypothetical losses Some of them are too sophisticated toconvert into financial terms one banking source said But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions isimpossible to calculate They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland seconomy and dismiss the billion dlr figure as illusory Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under achieving They did have a bad effect yes but they onlycontributed to largely internal economic problems one said The U S Imposed the measures and withdrew Most FavouredNation MFN trading status from Poland in in retaliationfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union undermartial law The estimated cost to the Polish economy wasoriginally devised several years ago by the Institute ofNational Economy an offshoot of the central planningcommission According to one Western envoy an expert on Polisheconomic affairs it extrapolated information on growthtrends in trade with the United States as well as increases incredits from Western commercial and government lenders But the calculations were based on a time when trade wasbooming and credits still flowed freely he said dismissingthe estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point which has no real scientific evaluation A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports tothe U S In the late s averaged around mln dlrsannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions wereimposed Imports have suffered slumping from around mln dlrs to mln as credits ran out Poland has a dwindling tradesurplus with the West Last year it was one billion dlrsagainst a targeted billion official figures show Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland importantU S Markets including agricultural equipment textiles chemicals and some foodstuffs Western economists say creditsdried up for economic not political reasons Poland isaccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate forpolitical reasons said one expert It s an illusion based on amisunderstanding of Western economy There s a limit to how much you can go on giving someonewho has no hope of repaying it another said adding thatPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy creditsin the s which were no longer today s reality Describing the billion dlr assessment as nebulous onediplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical ordersand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing ofscientific links and exchanges Western officials say thelifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impacton Poland which has a hard currency debt of billion dlrsand lacks the means to modernise its industry MFN doesn t really mean anything only that Poland will notbe treated worse than other countries It will be difficult toregain access to the U S Market because different forces arein play now said one Western envoy He said Polish products were not competitive and theirquality was too low Trade wars and possible protectionistmeasures amongst the U S Japan and Europe would also hamperPoland s efforts to regain entry Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognisedthis fact recently Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently Makingup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonlydifficult and in certain cases impossible In a period oftwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level ofexports by only about mln dlrs While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation it says ithas a moral right to assistance from the U S Which it saysimposed the sanctions illegally But a Western economist said The argument that U S Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoingof the Polish economy won t cut any ice The Americans willjust reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushingSolidarity Nevertheless Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka intalks in Washington last week with the International MonetaryFund IMF and World Bank made it clear that Poland waslooking for a lead from the United States He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet itsfinancial obligations to the United States but not in a shorttime and not without a cooperative stand on the part of itsforeign economic partners He stressed that the U S had a particular opportunity toplay a part in the cooperative policy of Poland s partnersinterested in the settlement of Polish debt Putting it more sharply one senior banking official blamedWashington for obstructing talks with the World Bank IMF andParis Club of Western creditor governments in recent years andsaid it should now play a more positive role As a major superpower the United States can influenceinternational organisations he said citing recent meetingsaimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent towhich Western nations were

5,BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS AUTHOR By Brian Killen Reuters AUTHOR CHICAGO March Brazil s recent announcement of asuspension in interest payments on billion dlrs of foreigndebt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed viewsamong many international economists and commodities analyststhat Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in The developing world s most indebted nation is also itsmost prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such ascoffee and soybeans and might maximize foreign exchangerevenue by selling hard on world markets economists said That sounds like a reasonable strategy But there is noway they can trade their way out of this situation AldoRoldan Vice President for International Services at ChaseEconometrics said Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle theproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on gluttedworld markets but also had to work to make its position onforeign exchange markets more profitable Domestic costs have increased due to inflation andexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchangerates Roldan said The Chase economist also said commodities markets weredepressed and generally did not appear very promising for acountry like Brazil where pure commodities account for some pct of exports and in had a total value of around billion dlrs But he added They are always pretty aggressive and theyhave good foreign marketing channels Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will becoffee and even without background pressure from foreigncreditors the world s largest producer was expected to hit themarket this year with a vengeance Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ICO members to re establish producer export quotas broke upearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusingeach other of intransigence Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations which others wanted changed one senior coffee dealer said The dealer who declined to be named said Brazil wanted topreserve its market share At the end of the talks he saidBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and otherswould suffer Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario butas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales thedealer said If they do come into the market at this level it will golower and you could breach a dollar ninety or eighty cents he said New York coffee futures for May delivery settled centslower Thursday at cents a lb while more distantdeliveries fell the six cent maximum trading limit President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute Jorio Daustertold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil hasno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown ofthe ICO talks on export quotas Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be thefocus of possible stepped up Brazilian marketing efforts Theywill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been according to Richard Loewy analyst for Prudential BacheSecurities Inc Loewy believes the foreign debt problem a good crop plusdifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of theBrazil soybean crop Brazilian farmers also need cash flow andthey can t afford to store the crops he said The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some timeabout large South American crops developing under near idealconditions towards record yields We are going to see a very rapid decline earlier thanusual this year in our U S exports Loewy said Tommy Eshleman economist for the American SoybeanAssociation ASA said this year s Brazilian soybean harvestcould total mln tonnes versus mln last year Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when pricesare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to thevulnerability of the U S crop to bad growing weather Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of areduction in the U S government soybean loan rate offered tofarmers who give crops as collateral Eshleman said He said there has been some uncertainty this year about thesoybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for pricesby keeping supplies away from the free market Farmers canforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay theloan We re getting into a period when they Brazil arestarting to harvest and starting to export Eshleman said Buthe added it will be a while before U S exports fall to below mln bushels a week from around mln bushels currently Jose Melicias from the research department of DrexelBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as muchas it can this year because of its economic situation He said the debt situation was a major consideration TheBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay forstorage he added Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazilwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops Melicias saidit would not make a big difference On other commodity markets Brazil s selling impact may bemuted no matter its need to generate capital Brazil is faced with a poor sugar harvest whichcould limit exports to the world market analysts said Thecountry may have oversold and be unable to honor exportcommitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused byconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar willgive it little room to stretch exports they said Brazil s other major crop cocoa is in its third year ofsurplus Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year itfell so I don t think they can start throwing out cocoa andfind many more

5,ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT U S DEFICIT WITH NICs AUTHOR By Claire Miller Reuters AUTHOR NEW YORK March The U S trade deficit with Taiwan andKorea is expected to widen this year despite some economic andcurrency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries economists said The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U S in will get bigger This time next year the U S will bescreaming at those countries about their exports said SteveCerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U S after Japan and Canada while Korea is the seventh largest Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoricagainst Taiwan and Korea urging those countries to allow theircurrencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade The thrust has shifted to those newly industrializedcountries NICs amid signs the dollar s steep drop against thecurrencies of Japan and most EC nations previously the mainfocus of the U S drive to cut its trade gap is beginning toclose the competiveness gap for American goods U S Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that heexpects a reduction in Japan s trade surplus this year But U S manufacturers still are losing markets on theirown doorstep to Taiwan and Korea whose currencies have notrisen as much as the yen and the mark As major beneficiariesof soft oil prices and with low labor costs Taiwanese andKorean exporters are well placed to take up the slack In the fashionable comment in Washington wasJapan bashing Now it s NIC bashing said Robert Chandross ofLloyds Bank PLC Asia s four main NICs Hong Kong South Korea Singaporeand Taiwan accounted for almost one fifth of the overall billion dlr U S merchandise trade deficit for The U S trade gap with Taiwan rose to billion dlrs in from billion in while the bilateral tradedeficit with South Korea grew to billion from billion And preliminary U S data show that the growth trend iscontinuing The U S trade shortfall with Taiwan was billion dlrs in January up pct from a year earlier Thegap with Korea was mln dlrs up pct from a year ago Lately both nations have said they will take steps todefuse incipient trade tensions Korea said it is choosing manyof the items on which the U S wants it to cut importtariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation Still South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said lastweek that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three tofive years as a way to cut its billion dlr foreign debt For its part Taiwan said in January that it will cuttariffs on goods sometime in the second half of andtry to diversify exports But vice economic minister WangChien Shien said last month that he still does not expectTaiwan s trade surplus with the U S will fall in The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textilesand electronic goods But Korea is raising its profile in thearea of big ticket manufactured goods notably cars Korea expects its auto exports mostly for North America to balloon to units in from zero in The NICs exports are almost all manufactured goods Whentheir exports rise it hits the heart of the U S manufacturingbase It cuts directly to us and to our customers said BobWendt manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp The U S takes pct of Korea s computer products exports pct of its electrical appliances and pct of itstelecommunications equipment A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan andSouth Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U S While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with theU S these are offset by their deficits with other countries But Taiwan and to a lesser extent South Korea stand inmarked contrast Both of these nations have moved rapidly intolarge bilateral surplus with the U S and major overrall tradeand current account surpluses the Morgan study says Morgan expects Taiwan s overall trade surplus to grow to billion dlrs in from billion last year andKorea s to increase to billion dlrs from billion Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U S A lot of Korea and Taiwan s exports to the U S have beenat Japan s expense said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp February s Paris meeting of six major industrial powersexorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies But this two pronged approach has drawn little responsefrom the two nations so far and in any case will only workwith a sizeable lag economists say The U S has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan s andKorea s currencies should climb The Taiwan dollar which ispegged to the U S dollar has risen about pct sinceSeptember while the Korean won has risen about five pct But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat againstthe U S unit and the won has lost seven pct economists say We ve not seen any lessening of competition from thosecountries that we can attribute to currency changes saidBethlehem Steel s Wendt And so far U S pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use theirhefty export earnings to import more have had little effect Moreover it is uncertain how far U S protectionism willget given the administration s free trade stance It s hard tosee that anything will be passed much before year end And thenthe question is will it have teeth one economist said

5,U S ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH AUTHOR By Donna Smith Reuters AUTHOR WASHINGTON March The U S economy is showing somepromising signs of accelerated expansion despite thesluggishness of the fourth quarter last year privateeconomists say Some of the slowness experienced in the October Decemberperiod had been expected to spill over into the first quarterthis year as the tax law changes that went into effect inJanuary slowed business and consumer spending But some of the latest economic data show signs ofsurprising strength in the U S economy although someeconomists remain cautious about the outlook The Commerce Department reported today that new orders fordurable goods in February jumped by billion dlrs a six pctrise to billion dlrs Even excluding volatile defensegoods durable goods orders rose a healthy pct the agencysaid The February numbers surpassed the expectations of manyfinancial analysts whose predictions ranged from flat toincreases of up to five pct The January February employment statistics suggest theGross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth forthe first three months of this year said Lyle Gramley aneconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association The U S jobless rate in February and January was pct the lowest rate since March The number of new non farmjobs rose by in February after a gain inJanuary and a December increase the government said The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate ofabout three to pct in the first quarter said Gramley Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuildingtheir inventories and is not likely to be sustained in thesecond quarter Gramley said He expects a slowdown in thesecond quarter with smaller increases in personal consumptionand government spending He also sees residential constructiondeclining mostly for multi family housing units Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of thefourth quarter slowness will continue Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant pct rate in thefirst quarter of accelerate during the second quarter andshow a brisk pct annual rate in the third quarter The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in theU S trade balance which is expected because of the decline inthe dollar s value over the last year and half The improvement will be gradual and long lasting Levypredicted Most of it will be through import reduction but atleast one third will be due to a rise in product exports as theprices of U S goods become more attractive overseas The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit which soared to record levels last year will improve this yearand the U S economy will grow by a respectable pct for theyear compared with a pct rate last year As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit the U S has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate theirdomestic demand for goods from the U S and others U S officials believe that would help take some of thepressure off the United States whose five years of economicgrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries The U S economy provided them with a giant market fortheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed toservice their foreign debt The government last week said the U S economy grew at amodest pct annual rate during the fourth quarter There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalancebetween the volume of goods imported to the United States andthose shipped abroad The report showed a rising volume ofexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the factthat in current dollar terms the U S trade deficit worsenedduring the closing three months of While fourth quarter economic growth was weak corporateprofits jumped a healthy pct during the period thegovernment said It also reported that inflation as measuredby the GNP price deflator remained in check growing amoderate pct in the period the lowest rise in years The government also reported that consumer spending a keyelement of the five year economic recovery jumped pct inFebruary after falling two pct in January The Federal Reserve Board also reported that themanufacturing sector which had been one of the weaker elementsof the U S economy was showing signs of recovery In its latest report on current economic conditions theFed said that economic activity in the various regions of thecountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in mostregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said thepick up in the U S manufacturing sector is largely due to thedrop in the dollar s value He said he does not foresee a majorpick up in economic activity but does not believe the economywill slip into recession either He said higher prices on imported products and wage cutsthat have helped the manufacturing sector will squeezeconsumers purchasing power That pattern is starting and will continue for a number ofyears Chimerine said He sees economic growth hovering arounda modest two pct level for the next few years

5,U S APPEARS TO TOLERATE FURTHER DLR DECLINE AUTHOR By Peter Torday Reuters AUTHOR WASHINGTON March In a bid to hasten Japan s promiseto speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreigntrade top U S officials appear once again to have signaledtheir tolerance of a lower dollar Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides Assistant Secretary David Mulford said last week there was notarget for the dollar a statement that sent the yen soaringagainst the dollar despite massive central bank intervention That was no slip of the tongue said one western monetaryofficial who asked not to be identified For now the strategy appears to be working Japaneseofficials said late last week a package to bolster domesticdemand will be ready in early April Until last week therewere few indications the package would be ready anytime soon The Reagan administration facing an uproar in Congressover the apparent lack of progress in cutting the billiondlr trade deficit is learning now that to extract results fromJapan dramatic action is required Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs oncertain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhereto a semi conductor pricing accord between the two countries The shift in U S strategy in part designed to appeasemounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies comes justtwo weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to reviewthe Paris agreement to stabilize currencies And news that Japan earned a record billion dlr tradesurplus in the first two months this year just underscored theneed for urgent action in the view of U S officials Nonetheless U S officials see signs of improvement in thedeficit I d be stunned if we were not going to derive somebenefits from the lower dollar soon said one In Paris leading industrial nations agreed to cooperateclosely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting underlying economic fundamentals or economic reality The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japanand West Germany stimulating their economies and the UnitedStates cutting its budget deficit The three nations joined by France Britain and Canada agree these policies are essential to redress huge global tradeimbalances But analysts say markets have signalled the underlyingfundamentals imply a lower dollar rather than a stable one Markets in effect are less confident than governmentsthat these measures including U S budget deficit cutsagreed by Congress and the White House will be carried out Nonetheless the dollar s sharp fall has not undermined cooperation A U S economic policymaker said the accord was ontrack and Tokyo and Bonn seem to want more stimulative measureswhich is what the Paris accord calls for International monetary sources said exchange marketdevelopments generally have not unsettled policymakers although Japan is an obvious exception Everybody feels it canstill be managed one source said of market developments But last week the Bank of Japan spent an estimated fivebillion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen and othercentral banks about one billion dlrs Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America shalf hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar flouting theParis accord outright The source close to the top levels of Japanese economicpolicymaking said Japan s understanding of the accord was thatthe yen would be kept at around to the dollar the level itstood at when the accord was struck The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington suse of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies It was a pointed reminder to Japan to do something about the tradeissues the source said of the dollar s fall against the yen By departing last Sunday from the language of the Parisaccord that nations agreed to foster currency stabilityaround current levels Baker triggered a run on the dollar Later in the week Mulford too said there was no target forthe dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up totheir international responsibilities and stimulate growth But U S officials said recent market developments will notunravel the spirit of the Paris agreement There s a realisation now that you cannot leave thingsalone everyone agrees that the external trade imbalancesought to be adjusted one official said While no one is going to cede national sovereignty wecertainly seem to be moving towards much closer co operation another U S official said The officials said the meeting here where the six will bejoined by Italy will be a status report Japan will have to explain what the state of their programis and Germany will report on its plans Maybe there s a needto move faster one source said Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called ineffect for currency stability for several months This wouldbuy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economicgrowth and help bring down the U S trade deficit His comments appeared to serve notice on other majornations that Washington cannot wait too long for action toreduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surplusesand the U S trade deficit
